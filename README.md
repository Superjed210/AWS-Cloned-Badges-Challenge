# AWSxNFL-Badge-Access-Proj

This repository contains my completed solution to the AWS × NFL Next Gen Stats Symposium 2025 Cybersecurity & Data Analytics challenge:

I created a reusable program to identify users that appear to have their badge cloned, such that they appear in multiple geographic locations within a short timeframe. These are flagged as anomalies, they are impossible travelers.

My solution analyzes badge-access logs, detects suspicious user movement patterns, and flags potential badge-cloning events using time-distance conflicts.
